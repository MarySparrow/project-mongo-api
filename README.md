# Week 18, Mongo API Project

- How to model data in Mongoose
- How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- How to seed large amounts of data to a database

## The problem

Requiurements: 
- API should have at least 2 routes. 
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection result
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result 
- API should make use of Mongoose models to model your data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
- Your API should be [RESTful]

stretch goals: 
- If you are doing any sort of manipulation after retrieving the data from the database.  Try using mongoose to do these operations instead.
- Accept filters via query parameters to filter (via mongoose) the data you return from endpoints which return an array of data.
